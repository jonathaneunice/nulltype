        Adds ``NonNullType``, an alternative for truthy sentinels.
        (Most use cases should still use ``NullType``; "full" sentinels recommended
        for odd cases only.)

    date: null
    notes: >
        Starts major upgrade from just Boolean operations being nulled
        to essentially all sorts of accesses and updates being nulled. It defines two
        default ``NullType`` instances, ``Null`` and ``Nothing``. The ability
        to have anonymous (unnamed) nulls has been removed as superfluous.
